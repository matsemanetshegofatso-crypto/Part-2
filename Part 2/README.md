## 7. Timeline and Milestones

_To be added._

## 8. Budget

_To be added._

## 9. Implementation Progress

**Pages built:**
- `index.html` — Home page, complete with responsive header, nav, product gallery, and contact info
- `about.html` — in progress
- `services.html` — in progress
- `enquiry.html` — not yet built
- `contact.html` — not yet built

**Stylesheet:**
- All pages share one external stylesheet, `style.css`, instead of repeating inline `<style>` blocks
- Includes a CSS reset, base typography, a responsive nav (stacked on mobile, row on tablet/desktop), a responsive product image grid, and a global rule so any image on any page scales to fit its container
- Breakpoints: `768px` (tablet) and `1024px` (desktop), mobile-first

**Responsive images:**
- `Cake.png` and `Cupcakes.png` have been resized into `-400w` and `-800w` versions and use `srcset`/`sizes` so smaller devices download smaller files
- `Sweets.png` is only available as a single small file (240×328px) — too low-resolution to generate an `-800w` version; a higher-resolution source photo is needed
- `Chocolate.png` has been resized into `-400w` and `-800w` versions, ready to use once its correct placement on the site is confirmed


**Outstanding items:**
- Fix repeated `heighr` typo (should be `height`) on the Services page image
- Replace deprecated `bgcolor` and `align` HTML attributes with CSS across all pages
- Add `alt` text to all images site-wide
- Confirm placement of the Chocolate hamper image (About page vs Services page)
- Build out `enquiry.html` and `contact.html`
- Get a higher-resolution photo of the sweets/hampers product
